/**
 * A filter is applied on either the annotator result or the dataset gold standard.
 * The filter chain works as follows. The entities are unwrapped and only all the uris are collected as so called
 * "entity names". The uris are then tested if there are a valid iri (using jena) and "whitelisted"
 * in the filter.properties discarding everything not passing the test.
 * Then depending on the configuration there are split into parts and cached.
 * At least a concrete filter is applied and the filter result is transformed back into entities valid for evaluation.
